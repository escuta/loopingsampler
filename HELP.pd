#N canvas 108 60 945 570 12;
#X text 440 -165 4) "STOP" and "REPLAY" stop and restart looping. The
same panel contains a "VOLUME" control for playback volume as well
as buttons to "CLEAR LOOP" and "CLEAR SNAPSHOTS" (see below).;
#X text 440 -91 5) Snapshots of current loop may be taken with "STORE
SNAPSHOT" and recalled with "RECALL SNAPSHOT". When the "WAIT" toggle
is selected \, recall of a snapshot will occur at the end of the prior
cycle.;
#X text 440 -16 6) Yellow panel has controls to stream audio to file.
Don't forget to "STOP RECORDING" when done!;
#X text 440 29 7) The "tables" abstraction (salmon panel) requires
the argument of loop memory time in samples. This sets the maximum
duration for loops. Note if either "LOAD" or "RESTORE" is used to load
a stereo sample or samples of a larger size \, all snapshot arrays
and the two loop arrays will be resized accordingly.;
#X text 10 54 2) Alternatively \, use "LOAD" to load a stereo file
from disk. Note \, if the size of this file is larger than sample memory
allocated in the "tables" abstraction (salmon coloured panel \, see
help 7.) \, all sample and snapshot arrays will be resized accordingly.
Note that like "RECORD" \, "LOAD" may be used more than once in a session
\, however if the file is larger than the memory allocated in the "tables"
abstraction \, all snapshots will be lost.;
#X text 10 194 3) Use the "OVERLAY" toggle to create an overlay on
active loop. Turn toggle on before the end of the current loop. The
recording of the overlay will commence at the start of the loop. If
the OVERLAY toggle is left on \, a new overlay will be recorded on
each cycle. When input is in mono and if the randomise button is selected
\, each overlay is panned between left and right channels at random
\, the degree to which \, is determined by the "% random stereo speparation"
value. Note \, that this percentage can be greater than 100% if a higher
probability of hard-left or hard-right panning is desired on each overlay.
Alternatively \, a specific panning for each overlay may be selected
with the slider.;
#X text 10 -165 1) Initially \, use "RECORD" toggle to record a loop
that will serve as a master for subsequent overlays. The loop length
is determined by the expired time when the toggle is switched off.
If the "randomise" toggle is selected in the blue "MONO INPUT PANNING"
panel \, this loop will be panned to the central position with subsequent
overlays panned randomly between the left and right channel. A specific
pan value may be selected with the slider. Adjust "INPUT GAIN" if necessary.
Note that RECORD can be used more than once in a session \, with any
stored snapshots retained. The "STEREO INPUT" toggle selects stereo
rather than mono input. When stereo input is selected the "MONO INPUT
PANNING" module is disabled.;
#X text 440 140 8) Project may be saved or restored using the dark
grey PROJECT DATA panel. The path and project name \, eg. /tmp/test
\, must be entered manually as an argument to the "dataStore" abstraction.
For Windows \, use forward slashes in path and again \, with no quotes
\, eg. C:/Users/youruser/Desktop/test. Note that the project is saved
as two files in directory specified in the path: a multichannel wav
file to store the audio arrays and a text file to store the loop durations.
If the project is named test \, for example \, the files saved are
test.wav and test.txt.;
